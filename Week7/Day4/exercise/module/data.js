// Instructions

//     Create a file named data.js.

//     Inside data.js, define an array of objects, each representing a person with properties like name, age, and location.
export let people = [{
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    location: "New York"
  },
  {
    name: "Bob",
    age: 25,
    location: "San Francisco"
  },
  {
    name: "Charlie",
    age: 35,
    location: "Chicago"
  }]

  
//     Export the array using the ES6 module syntax.

//     Create another file named app.js.

//     In app.js, import the array of person objects from the data.js module.

//     Write a function that calculates and prints the average age of all the persons in the array.

//     Use the imported array and the average age function in app.js.

//     Run app.js and confirm that the average age is correctly calculated and displayed.
