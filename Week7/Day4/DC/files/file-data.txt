Task 3: Advanced File Operations

    Inside the daily-challenge directory, create a directory named files.

    Inside the files directory, create a file named file-data.txt and add some text content to it.

    Create a file named read-file.js.

    In read-file.js, require the fs module and read the content from the file-data.txt file. Display the content in the terminal.

    Create another file named app.js.

    In app.js, require the read-file.js module and call the function you’ve written to display the file’s content.

    Run app.js using Node.js and see the content of the file.
