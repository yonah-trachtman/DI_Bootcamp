dictionary1 = zip(keys, values)
dictionary1 = dict(dictionary1)
print(dictionary1)



# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Cinemax #2
# Instructions

#     A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
#         if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
#         if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
#         if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

#     Given the following object:

#     family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


#     How much does each family member have to pay ?
#     Print out the familyâ€™s total cost for the movies.
#     Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

# Code starts here!!!!
family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
totalCost = 0
for value in family.values():
    
    if value > 12:
        totalCost += 15
    elif value < 13 and value > 3:
        totalCost += 10

print(totalCost)
