ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Building a RESTful API with database connection
Instructions

Youâ€™re tasked with building a RESTful API for a blog platform.
Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete blog posts using different endpoints.

    Create a directory named blog-api.

    Inside the blog-api directory, open a terminal and run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

    Install the express package by running npm install express in the terminal.

    Create a file named server.js.

    In server.js, require the express package and set up an Express app.

    Create a posts table in postgres database, with the properties like id, title, and content.

    Implement the following routes using Express:
    GET /posts: Return a list of all blog posts.
    GET /posts/:id: Return a specific blog post based on its id.
    POST /posts: Create a new blog post.
    PUT /posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.

    DELETE /posts/:id: Delete a blog post.

    Create this directory structure:

    server
        |_ config
        |_ controllers
        |_ models
        |_ routes


    Implement error handling for invalid routes and server errors.

    Start the Express app and listen on a specified port (e.g., 3000).
