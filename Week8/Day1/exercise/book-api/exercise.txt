🌟 Exercise 2 : Building a Basic CRUD API with database connection
Instructions

In this exercise, you’ll build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Express.js. Your task is to create routes to manage a collection of books.

    Create a new directory named book-api.

    Inside the book-api directory, initialize a new Node.js project and install the express package.

    Create a new file named app.js in the book-api directory.

    In app.js, import the express module and create an instance of an Express app.

    Define a basic data books table with properties like id, title, author, and publishedYear.

    Create this directory structure:

    server
        |_ config
        |_ controllers
        |_ models
        |_ routes


    Set up the app to listen on port 5000. Print a message in the console to indicate that the server is running.

    Implement the “Read all” route by defining a route at GET /api/books. Send a JSON response with the books array.

    Implement the “Read” route by defining a route at GET /api/books/:bookId. Extract the bookId parameter from the URL and use it to find the corresponding book in the books array. If the book is found, send a JSON response with the book details and a status code of 200 (OK). If the book is not found, send a 404 status with a “Book not found” message.

    Implement the “Create” route at POST /api/books.
