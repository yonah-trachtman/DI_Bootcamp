# üåü Exercise 1: Cats
# Instructions

# Using this class

# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
#         self.name = cat_name
#         self.age = cat_age

#     Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
#     Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
#     Print the following string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù. Use the function previously created.


class Cat:
    def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
        self.name = cat_name
        self.age = cat_age

def findCat(catList: list[Cat]) -> Cat:
        oldestCat = catList[0]
        for cat in catList:
            if cat.age > oldestCat.age:
                oldestCat = cat
        return oldestCat




# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions

#     Create a class called Dog.
#     In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
#     Create a method called bark that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> goes woof!‚Äù.
#     Create a method called jump that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!‚Äù. x is the height*2.
#     Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúRex‚Äù and his height is 50cm.
#     Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
#     Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúTeacup‚Äù and his height is 20cm.
#     Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
#     Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.


class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name : str, height : int | float) -> None:
        self.name = name
        self.height = height



    def bark(self) -> None:
        print(f"{self.name} goes woof")

    def jump(self) -> None:
        print(f"{self.name} jumps {self.height * 2} cm high!")

def introduceDog(dog: Dog):
    print(f"this dog's name is {dog.name} and it is {dog.height} cm")




# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs the song producer?
# Instructions

#     Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
#     Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
#     Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.

#     Create an object, for example:

#     stairway= Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"])


#     Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

#     There‚Äôs a lady who's sure
#     all that glitters is gold
#     and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven



class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics: list) -> None:
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    def singMeASong(self):
        for lyrics in self.lyrics:
            print(lyrics)



            
# Exercise 4 : Afternoon at the Zoo
# Instructions

#     Create a class called Zoo.
#     In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
#     It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
#     Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn‚Äôt already in the list.
#     Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
#     Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.

#     Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
#     Example

#     { 
#         1: "Ape",
#         2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#         3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#         4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
#     }


#     Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.
#     Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
#     Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
#     Example

#     Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
#     x.add_animal(Giraffe)
