# Instructions : Old MacDonald’s Farm

#     Take a look at the following code and output:

# File: market.py

# macdonald = Farm("McDonald")
# macdonald.add_animal('cow',5)
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('sheep')
# macdonald.add_animal('goat', 12)
# print(macdonald.get_info())

# Output

# McDonald's farm

# cow : 5
# sheep : 2
# goat : 12

#     E-I-E-I-0!


# Create the code that is needed to receive the result provided above. Below are a few questions to assist you with your code:

#     Create a class called Farm. How should it be implemented?
#     Does the Farm class need an __init__ method? If so, what parameters should it take?
#     How many methods does the Farm class need?
#     Do you notice anything interesting about the way we are calling the add_animal method? What parameters should this function have? How many…?
#     Test your code and make sure you get the same results as the example above.
#     Bonus: nicely line the text in columns as seen in the example above. Use string formatting.


# Expand The Farm

#     Add a method called get_animal_types to the Farm class. This method should return a sorted list of all the animal types (names) in the farm. With the example above, the list should be: ['cow', 'goat', 'sheep'].

#     Add another method to the Farm class called get_short_info. This method should return the following string: “McDonald’s farm has cows, goats and sheeps.”. The method should call the get_animal_types function to get a list of the animals.
#         Note : In English the plural form of the word “sheep” is sheep. But for the purpose of the exercise, let’s say that if there is more than 1 animal, an “s” should be added at the end of the word.
