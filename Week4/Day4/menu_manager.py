# In the file menu_manager.py, create a new class called MenuManager

#     Create a Class Method called get_by_name that will return a single item from the Menu_Items table depending on itâ€™s name, if an object is not found (there is no item matching the name in the get_by_name method) return None.

#     Create a Class Method called all_items which will return a list of all the items from the Menu_Items table.
