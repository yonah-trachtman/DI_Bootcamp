Die Geschichte dreht sich um einen modernen Mann, der in eine mittelalterliche Welt transportiert wird, um Drachen zu verstehen und die Magie zu retten. Mit einer gro√üartigen musikalischen Untermalung und charismatischen Charakteren ist "Flight of Dragons" ein unvergessliches Erlebnis f√ºr Fantasy-Fans jeden Alters. Trotz einiger veralteter Animationstechniken bleibt der Film ein zeitloser Klassiker.',
